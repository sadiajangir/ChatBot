User said: i have a sister
Bot responded: I see, you're telling me about private stuff (Ahmmmm...). Why don't you write it in the following format so I can better understand you. You can write '_' around primary object, '-' around secondary object and '+' around relation. For example: '-Ali- is _my_ +friend+' or '_I_ have a +friend+ -Ali-' or '_Ahmad_ +likes+ -icecream-'
